CATEGORY GRAPHICS

The category graphics in this folder were created by Georgia Public Library Service and may be freely used in any Evergreen KPAC implementation. If you wish to create your own graphics in a consistent style, you may create them using either of these template graphics:

* cat-blank.png
* KPAC_Category_Button_Template.psd



PROPRIETARY GRAPHICS

Proprietry graphics whose copyright is owned by Georgia Public Library Service and which may only be used by Georgia PINES and NOT by any other Evergreen implementation include: 

* PINES_logo.gif
* KPAC_Main_Graphic.jpg
* goat.png
* quack.png


If you wish to install this version of the KPAC and utilize the included CSS and graphics with the exception of these four proprietary graphics, then you will need to create replacement graphics for them. The background color is hex code #e0f1fb (rgb 224,241,251) and the relevant sizes are:

* PINES_logo.gif (270px x 54px)
* KPAC_Main_Graphic.jpg (950px x 440px)
* goat.png (266px x 641px)
* quack.png (266px x 641px)
